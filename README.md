# DSA and CP Solutions

This repository contains my solutions to various Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) problems and Competitive Programming (CP) challenges from multiple platforms.

## Contents

- Solutions to problems across different categories such as arrays, linked lists, trees, graphs, dynamic programming, sorting, searching, recursion, backtracking, bit manipulation, and more.
- Implementations in JAVA.
- Problems sourced from popular platforms like LeetCode, Codeforces, HackerRank, CodeChef, AtCoder, and GeeksforGeeks.
- Each solution includes code and sometimes brief explanations or comments to aid understanding.

## Notes

This repository is an ongoing collection of my problem-solving efforts in DSA and CP, and it will continue to grow as I solve more problems and tackle new challenges.

Feel free to explore the solutions, learn from the code, and use it as a reference for your own learning.
